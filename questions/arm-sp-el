I'm assuming that this question is asking about a program that was executing in
EL0 before the exception occured, because there is no option to switch the stack
pointer to that stored for an arbitrary ELn, the only options are use the SP for
the current exception level, or use the SP for EL0.

msr SPSel, #0
# move address B into the stack pointer
mov SP, #B
# switch back to SP_n
msr SPSel, #1
