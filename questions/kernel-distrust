Yes, the process must trust the kernel. The kernel has unrestricted access to
all of the processes resources, including memory, disk, network, etc. One
example of this is that a process could store private keys or other secrets in
memory or on disk. If the kernel is compromised, it could read these secrets and
transmit them over the network or do something else damaging.
