This will be accomplished through paging. As the stack pointer decreases, it
will eventually move on to a page that has not yet been allocated. When the
process tries to access memory at an address within that page, a page fault will
occur, which will allow the kernel to use the allocator to allocate a new page
and add a page table entry.
